__Oval__ is _just_ another browser extension that can summarizes the web page you are browsing.

But...it tries to give you an experience that is similar to the ["Pinch to Summarize"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcBrowser/comments/1ay42ra/pinch_to_summarize_behind_the_scenes/) feature from [Arc Search](https://arc.net/search). In fact, the prompt is stolen from Arc Search. Thanks _The Browser Company_!

Check it out on <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/oval/kogclmjmcggincppnnmdgacjmjmnlhhj">Chrome Web Store</a>
